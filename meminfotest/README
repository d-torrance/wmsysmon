This is a program used to benchmark your /proc/meminfo, you need to time it
using the time program (TIME(1)), simply run make to build it, then execute
it like so:

time ./test

If the results are over 30s of system time, your /proc/meminfo is slow.
On my P166MMX overclocked to 187Mhz it takes 12s system time, on a dual
ppro 180Mhz we tested it took 1:02s (yes, thats 1 minute and 2 seconds).
Both were running kernel 2.2.

We also ran the same test on a 400Mhz celeron using both 2.2 and 2.4, on 2.2
it took 11s, on 2.4 it took 4s.

I would love to hear the results of any tests you perform using this, email
results to me.
