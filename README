Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
Well, i was bored this afternoon, so i decided to code this.

Its a system monitor util for your wm/afterstep dock.

It monitors Memory, Swap, Disk IO, uptime and interrupts.

kinda pretty looking.

ok ok, everyone has been complaining about the docs (or lack thereof)

here's how the applet is laid out:

-------------------
|[---------------]|  <--- Memory Use %
|[---------------]|  <--- Swap Use %
|[---------------]|  <--- I/O %
|                 |
|   000:00:00     |  <--- Uptime days:hours:minutes
|                 |
| 01234567   WX   |  <--- 0-F are hardware interrupts 0-15
| 89ABCDEF   YZ   |  <--- W,X are Page IN/OUT
-------------------  <--- Y,Z are Swap IN/OUT


That should explain things a little better.  Phew.. I love asci drawings.

Mail me with ideas/comments/bug reports, etc....
